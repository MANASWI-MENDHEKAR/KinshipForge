## What This Project Does

KinshipForge extends the StyleGene framework to generate one consistent 
child face at three age stages — 5-10, 11-15, and 16-21 years — from 
just two parent photographs. Unlike the original StyleGene paper which 
generates 40 independent sibling-like children per pair, this project 
maintains identity consistency across all three age outputs using a 
frozen DNA seed approach.

## Five Original Contributions

| Contribution | Description |
|---|---|
| Frozen DNA Seed | Fixes crossover weights (α, β) across all 3 age stages — same genetic blueprint, visible aging via pool variation |
| LERP Bucket Blending | Linearly interpolates FFHQ pool age buckets to create intermediate age genes for each output stage |
| Gender-biased Layer Fusion | 70/30 father/mother weighting on StyleGAN2 layers 8-17 for male, 30/70 for female — replaces paper's fixed 50/50 |
| Multi-seed Selection | Runs seeds [42, 123, 256], selects seed with maximum LPIPS age progression — improved mean LPIPS from 0.207 to 0.267 |
| Gene Pool Rebuild | Rebuilt researchers' 27.8 GB inaccessible pool from FFHQ 70k — 56 keys, 100 samples/bucket, 8.71 GB |

## Results

![Results](grid_detached_child.png)

Evaluated on 7 parent pairs across 5 ethnicities including Indian pairs 
absent from all existing benchmark datasets. Real child photographs used 
as ground truth for all 7 pairs.

| Metric | Mean | Threshold | Pairs above threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSIM vs real child | 0.282 | 0.25 | 6/7 |
| LPIPS age progression | 0.251 | 0.20 | 6/7 |
| ArcFace identity consistency | 0.393 | 0.25 | 7/7 |

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/KinshipForge.git
cd KinshipForge
```

### 2. Clone StyleGene and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CVI-SZU/StyleGene.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download model checkpoints
Checkpoints available at HuggingFace:  
https://huggingface.co/wmpscc/StyleGene_CKPT

Download these 5 files to `/tmp/ckpt/`:
- `e4e_ffhq_encode.pt`
- `stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pt`
- `stylegene_N18.ckpt`
- `res34_fair_align_multi_7_20190809.pt`
- `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2`

### 4. Download Gene Pool
Custom rebuilt gene pool (8.71 GB):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manaswimendhekar/stylegene-balanced-pool

Note: Due to data privacy and storage constraints, this Kaggle dataset is currently set to Private. Access can be granted to the evaluation committee upon request.

Access Request: This dataset contains sensitive biometric-derived feature pools and is currently set to Private to comply with data privacy policies. Authorized researchers and evaluation committee members may request access by sending their Kaggle username to the project maintainer.

Place at: `YOUR_DATASET/pool_50samples.pkl`

### 5. Run the Gradio UI
```bash
python child_face_gradio_ui.py
```

### 6. Or run the full notebook on Kaggle
Open `kinshipforge_notebook.ipynb` on Kaggle with T4 GPU enabled.  
Update dataset paths from `YOUR_DATASET` to your actual Kaggle dataset paths.

## Dataset Paths (Kaggle)

| Dataset | Path |
|---|---|
| Parent/child photos | YOUR_DATASET/locked-7-pairs/ |
| Gene Pool | YOUR_DATASET/stylegene-balanced-pool/pool_50samples.pkl |
| FFHQ 70k thumbnails | YOUR_DATASET/ffhq-face-data-set/thumbnails128x128/ |

## Known Limitations

- Age floor: StyleGAN2 trained on FFHQ lacks child faces below age 15 — outputs appear slightly older than target
- Indian female pool critically sparse: 0-2-female-Indian has only 1 sample due to FFHQ bias toward Western faces
- Mixed-race pool query: only first parent's race used for mutation (known bug, future fix)
- FairFace unreliable on celebrity photos — race labels hardcoded for all 7 evaluation pairs
